# MeanStackSkeleton
Template for MEAN stack applications, creating good starting point for getting right into application development

This skeleton has been put together based on a few recent mean stack websites I have worked on, namely

https://www.esotericuk.net/

http://178.62.38.36/ (Update to URL when it goes live next week)


The purpose of this repo is to allow me, and hopefully others, to start work on similar projects very quickly. The basic site is a modern responsive website using bootstrap, with full CMS capabilities via admin panel (Login with admin:password at /Admin). The example contains plain Rich Text editable CMS pages, a photo gallery and an example of a more customised page.

This skeleton will form the basis of a series of blog posts over at my blog https://camelofcode.wordpress.com/
Indeed, I've already written about the process of moving these projects over to Visual Studio 2017. More to come!
