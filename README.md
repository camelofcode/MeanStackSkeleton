# MeanStackSkeleton
Template for MEAN stack applications, creating good starting point for getting right into application development

This skeleton has been put together based on a few recent mean stack websites I have worked on, namely
https://www.esotericuk.net/
http://178.62.38.36/ (Update to URL when it goes live next week)

The purpose of this repo is to allow me, and hopefully others, to start work on similar projects very quickly.

This skeleton will form the basis of a series of blog posts over at my blog https://camelofcode.wordpress.com/
Indeed, I've already written about the process of moving these projects over to Visual Studio 2017. More to come!
